* Generate a schema

I used Claude Code with prompt

look at the existing schemas, and generate a new one for jazz musicians, bands, songs, recordings, genres, record labels in the same format

** Make a config

** Run and see the diagram

** Generate some data

** (maybe) adapt to reall database (eg Wikidata for Jazz musicians)

Demo of this and explain how it fixes LLM hallucination problem
